#firebase_gps_nodemcu
Well this repository demonstrates use of real time gps co-ordinates via node mcu connect to a wifi and firebase to have realtime date 
I have used node mcu,neo 6m,power bank(for power supply)
The connection are as follow
neo 6m rx -> D2 of node mcu
neo 6m tx -> D3 of node mcu
neo 6m vcc -> 3v3(power)
neo 6m gnd -> gnd of node mcu
